OVERVIEW
I've developed an advanced Credit Card Approver System with Streamlit, SHAP values, and data visualizations. This user-friendly system streamlines credit card approval with robust machine learning predictions and transparent SHAP explanations, while interactive visuals simplify understanding of decision factors.

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are pivotal for the Credit Card Approver System's transparency. They break down how each applicant attribute affects credit card approval, making the process clear. These numerical values help both financial institutions and applicants, promoting accountability, empowerment, and system sophistication beyond prediction to education and transparency.
